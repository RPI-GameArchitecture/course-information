Book: Game Engine Architecture, 3rd edition, by Jason Gregory (recommended)

Course Description: 

This is a class on the composition of game engines, some
of the most complex software applications that exist. We will discuss many
features common to game engines, such as collision detection, event
management, and scene graph manipulations. The first two-thirds of the class
will be primarily lecture-based, covering topics needed for all game engines. The
last third of the class will be primarily project-based, with individuals or teams
focusing on an aspect of game architecture that they would like to expand
further.

Learning Outcomes: 

Students will learn a more detailed understanding of the
subsystems that comprise a game engine, and how they interrelate. Each
student in the class with either create a minimalist game engine from scratch, or
make a notable contribution to an existing open-souce game engine.

Academic Honesty:

Student relationships are built on mutual respect and trust. Students must be
able to trust that their teachers have made responsible decisions about the
structure and content of the course and that they are conscientiously making
their best effort to help students learn. Teachers must be able to trust that
students do their work conscientiously and honestly making their best effort to
learn. Acts that violate this mutual respect and trust undermine the educational
process. They counteract our very reason for being here at Rensselaer and will
not be tolerated. Any student who engages in any form of academic dishonesty
will receive an F in this course and will be reported to the Dean of Students for
further disciplinary action. The Rensselaer Handbook defined various forms of
Academic Dishonesty and procedures for responding to them. All of these forms
are violations of trust between students and teachers. Please familiarize yourself
with this portion of the handbook.

Programming is rarely a purely solitary endeavor, but for the sake of academic
integrity, it is essential that you do your own work. There is a reasonable line
between asking people for help, and outright plagiarism. You may ask for help,
and you may show others your code, but you may not view their code. You may
help other people, but you may not show them your own work. Don't guilt-trip
people, and don't let yourself be guilt-tripped. Friends don't manipulate each
other.

You MAY:

•	Whiteboard solutions with others using diagrams or pseudocode but not
actual code.


•	Use the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course’s own, for
references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright
solutions to homeworks.


•	Incorporate snippets of code (2 lines as a guideline) that you find online or
elsewhere into your own code, provided that those snippets are not
themselves solutions to assigned problems and that you cite its origins.


•	Run someone else's code on your computer.


You may NOT:

•	Ask a classmate to see their solution to a problem before submitting your
own.

•	Give or show a classmate a solution to a problem when they are
struggling to solve it.

•	Search for or solicit outright solutions to problem online or elsewhere.

•	Split a problem’s workload with another individual and combining your
work.

•	Submit the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or
will submit to another.

•	Splitting a problem set’s workload with another individual and then
combine your work.

•	View another’s solution to a problem and then base your own solution on
it.


Grading: The graded assignments for this class will include six homework
assignments, each of which will expand our bare-bones engine. The final project
will be a software project kicked off by a pitch-style presentation. Your final
grade is determined as follows:

HW 1-6: 12.5% each

Final Project:  25%
